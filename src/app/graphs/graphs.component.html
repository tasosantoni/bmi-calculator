            The following graph refers to a study of 68.5 million people in 195 countries, that was conducted by the ongoing Global Burden of Disease Study, over 25 years.
            The study showed that of almost 4 million deaths related to a high BMI in 2015, more than two-thirds were caused by cardiovascular diseases.
